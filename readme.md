# Lavandula

**Lavandula** is a lightweight, fast, and intuitive C web framework designed for building modern web applications quickly. It focuses on simplicity, performance, and productivity, providing all the essentials without the bloat of heavier frameworks.


## Example

```c
HttpResponse home(HttpRequest _) {
    return ok("Hello, World!");
}

int main() {
    // Initialize the application builder
    AppBuilder builder = createBuilder();
    
    // Build the application
    App app = build(builder);

    // Define routes
    get(&app, "/home", home);

    // Run the application
    runApp(&app);

    // Cleanup leftover resources
    cleanupApp(&app);

    return 0;
}
```


## Features

- Controller and routing system
- HTTP endpoint support (GET, POST, etc)

- Minimal dependencies (pure C)
- Quick project scaffolding via the CLI
- Built-in unit testing framework

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Feel free to submit pull requests or open issues for feature requests or bugs.

Some things that probably need looking at are:
- memory leaks
- outdated and unfinished documentation (API changes warrant a docs update)
- The JSON library does not currently support nested lists
- Some tests need to be written...
