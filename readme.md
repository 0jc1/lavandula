# Lavandula

**Lavandula** is a lightweight, minimalist C web framework designed for building fast and simple web applications. It provides a small, intuitive API to define routes, render pages, and run a HTTP server without the complexity of heavier frameworks.

<br/>

*Lavandula 'Hello, World!' minimal example:*

```c
Page home() {
    Page p = page("Home");
    text(&p, "Hello, World!");

    return p;
}

int main() {
    App app = init(3000);

    route(&app.server.router, HTTP_GET, "/", home);

    runApp(&app);
    cleanupApp(&app);

    return 0;
}
```

## What is it, Really?

Lavandula is a web server, router, renderer, and framework toolkit for building readable and performant full-stack web applications. Using the Lavandula API, HTML, CSS, and JS are automatically generated from your C code, allowing you to write interactive web pages without manually writing frontend files.


## Features

- Intuitive routing system
- HTTP endpoint support (GET, POST, etc)
- Simple page rendering
- Minimal dependencies (pure C)
- Quick project scaffolding via the CLI


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashtonjamesd/lavandula.git
cd lavandula
```

... todo


## Quick Start

Use the Lavandula CLI with the following command to create a new project.

```
lavandula new myProject
```

You should see the following output once run.

```
Setting up Lavandula project 'myProject'...

-> Setup directories created successfully!
-> Created app.c
-> Created controllers/home_controller.c
-> Created routes.c
-> Created makefile

ðŸŽ‰ Lavandula project 'myProject' setup finished successfully!

Next steps:
  1. cd myProject
  2. Compile your project (e.g., gcc app.c -o app)
  3. Run your app: ./app
```

It automatically generates:
- `app.c`
- `routes.c`
- `controllers/home_controller.c`


## Compile and Run

```
make
./<exe>
```

Your app will start on port 3000, and visiting http://localhost:3000/ will display your application.


## Project Structure

```
myproject/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.c                  # Main application file
â”œâ”€â”€ routes.c               # Route registration
â”œâ”€â”€ controllers/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ home_controller.c  # Example page controller
â””â”€â”€ makefile               # Project makefile
```
