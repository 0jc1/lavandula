# Installing Lavandula

This guide assumes you have a GCC and Make installed.

Clone the Git repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashtonjamesd/lavandula.git
cd lavandula
```


Run the install script. This sets up the Lavandula CLI.

```bash
./install.sh
```

You should see the following.

```bash
[SUCCESS] ðŸŽ‰ Lavandula installation completed!

Quick Start:
 lavu new my-project # Create a new project
 cd my-project
 lavu run            # Run your project

Documentation:
 GitHub: https://github.com/ashtonjamesd/lavandula
```

You should now be able to run the Lavu CLI tool. Refer to `/api` for how to use Lavu.
