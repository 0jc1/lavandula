# Lavu

Lavu (lah-voo), the Lavandula CLI, can help you to quickly scaffold and setup your project.

Run the following command to create a new project.

```bash
lavu new <project_name>
```

Run the application.

```bash
lavu run
```

Note that `lavu run` will only work if the current working directory is the same as `lavandula.yml`.

You should see:

```
Lavandula Server is running! -> http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

To see more commands that you can execute, run the help command.

```
lavu help
```
